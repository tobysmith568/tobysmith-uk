My aim for the last week was to develop the menu system for my game. I started out with the main menu as this is the core of the menu system.

The buttons have a roll-over effect where they change colour to a specific contrasting colour, either: yellow, green, blue, purple. The title has a similar effect but cycles through each of those colours. The main panels of each menu do not also have this effect. On the splash menu the text at the bottom fades in and out – this is the only instance of this and while doesn’t fit the rest is almost a splash menu unwritten rule.

In the following week I hope to fine-tune the shooting mechanic by swapping the raycasts out for gameobjects.
