				<img class="me" src="assets/img/me.png" />

				<p class="about-para">I'm a {{ getAge() }}-year-old Computing and Video Games student at The University of Plymouth.
					<b>I'm currently looking for a graduate software development job in and around London.</b>
				</p>

				<p class="about-para">I started programming at 16 using Python but quickly moved on to C#, which remains one of
					my primary skills today.
				</p>

				<p class="about-para">At University, my course is split 50% between video games and standard software
					development. This means I've been able to gain an extensive education in using modern software
					development tools, techniques, and frameworks.
				</p>

				<p class="about-para">As a part of my studies, from June 2018 to August 2019, I completed a placement year
					at <a href="https://www.flooid.com/uk" target="_blank">Flooid Ltd.</a> (formerly PCMS Group Ltd.).
					My placement was a fantastic, eye-opening opportunity to gain real-world software development experience.
					As well as continually improving my abilities, I was also able to confirm that I genuinely enjoy software
					development on industry and career-wide scales.
