As this game is made for one of my university modules Iâ€™m also making documentation for it to be submitted. Today I handed in a proposal document for my game and I decided to also publish it here.

The document below includes an outline of the overall concept for this game, my breakdown of the game mechanics, my plans for current as well as future content, and other planning aspects including menu layouts and my sources of inspiration.
