While I was on my placement, I found that I was given lots of scripts to automate parts of my day-to-day development life. I also found myself creating my own scripts to fill in the gaps which weren't already covered.

The problem was that lots of these scripts need to be run from within a specific folder, and sometimes the same script needs to be run in multiple different folders; this is where Right-Click Commands becomes useful.

Using this tool, you can add scripts to the right-click context menu within Windows Explorer to be run wherever you right-click.

### Example 1

A simple example might be to add a script containing `git pull` to the right-click menu. This means that you can navigate to a Git repository within Explorer and then pull it without having to open up a Git client or terminal.

### Example 2

If you often work with projects which use npm, then you might consider adding `npm run start` to your Explorer context menu. Now you can start up projects easily without having to open a terminal.

### Conclusion

These examples are small and simple, but the program allows for complicated scripts to written which I certainly found good uses for on my placement, if you find any other good uses then I'd love to hear about them in the comments below.
