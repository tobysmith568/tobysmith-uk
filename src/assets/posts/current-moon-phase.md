This is an Amazon Alexa skill which tells you the current moon phase during your flash briefing.

Like all other flash briefing skills, it can be reordered in either the Alexa app or on the website.

### Skill Features:
 - Get a daily update in your flash briefing
### Developer Skills:
This is the first Alexa skill that I have developed. The actual code behind the skill is written in PHP and stored on my server, the Amazon skill then gets the information in a JSON format. While I have worked with PHP before in college, this is my first real use of it.
